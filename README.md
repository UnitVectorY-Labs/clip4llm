Grab your content and get back to prompting‚Äîfaster, easier, and smarter.

## üåü Features

- **Wildcard File Handling:** Why limit yourself to one file when you can have them all? Use wildcards to gather your files (e.g., `*.md`, `*.yaml`) and let **clip4llm** do the rest.
- **Hidden Gems:** Hidden files aren‚Äôt left behind. Grab those `.env` secrets like a pro.
- **Size Matters:** File too big? Not a problem. Set a size limit and skip the heavyweights. Default: 32KB, because nobody needs a novel-length paste job consuming your precious context window.
- **Mind the Megabyte:** Output over 1MB? Boom! That is too big so nope, not happening.
- **Binary Exclusion:** ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt speak binary‚Äîleave those files out automatically.
- **Config Magic:** Drop a `.clip4llm` config in your home directory or your project folder and forget about the command-line‚Äîyour preferences are locked and loaded.
- **Verbose Mode:** Want to see what‚Äôs going on behind the curtain? Crank up the verbosity and feel like a hacker.

## üîß Installation

You‚Äôve got Go installed, right? If not, ask ChatGPT how to instally it and let's get going...

1. Clone the magic:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unitvectory-labs/clip4llm.git
   cd clip4llm
   ```

2. Build it like a boss:

   ```bash
   go build -o clip4llm
   ```

3. Make it global:

   ```bash
   mv clip4llm /usr/local/bin/
   ```

4. Check your setup (just because):

   ```bash
   clip4llm --help
   ```

## üíª Usage

Time to flex. Navigate into your project directory and run:

```bash
clip4llm
```

This instantly grabs all non-hidden, non-binary files (under 32KB) in your current directory and copies them straight to your clipboard, ready for pasting into ChatGPT like a legend.

### Command-Line Options That Matter

- `--delimiter` ‚Äì Customize how each file is wrapped. Default is tripple `'s because Markdown rocks, but make it whatever you like:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --delimiter="<<<END>>>"
  ```

- `--max-size` ‚Äì Keep things trim. Files over this size (in KB) are skipped:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --max-size=8
  ```

- `--include` ‚Äì Specific about what you want? Use a comma-separated list of filenames or patterns, those files and folders starting with a . are automatically skipped so this is your opportunity to bring some of them back into the fold:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --include=".github,*.env"
  ```

- `--exclude` ‚Äì Want some files to disappear? Exclude 'em with style:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --exclude="LICENSE,*.md"
  ```

- `--verbose` ‚Äì Feeling nosy? Get the full play-by-play of what‚Äôs happening:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --verbose
  ```

### üî• Pro Tip Combos

- **Include Hidden Directory**: Just the `.github` folder, please:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --include=".github"
  ```

- **Exclude Markdown Files**: No `.md` files here:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --exclude="*.md"
  ```

- **Mix & Match**: Include `.env`, ditch `.md`:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --include="*.env" --exclude="*.md"
  ```

- **Customize Your Flow**: Use a custom delimiter and max file size, keep that LLM happy:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --delimiter="<<<FILE>>>" --max-size=64
  ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Like a Boss

Set it once, and forget it. Place a `.clip4llm` file in your home directory (`~/.clip4llm`) or project directory (`pwd/.clip4llm`), and **clip4llm** will respect your preferences.

Sample `.clip4llm` file:

```properties
delimiter=```
max-size=32
include=.github,*.env
exclude=LICENSE,*.md
```
