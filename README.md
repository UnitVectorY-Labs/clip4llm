# clip4llm üöÄ

Why waste time fiddling with files when you could be crafting prompts for your LLM? **clip4llm** takes the hassle out of manually copying file content into ChatGPT or any other LLM. This isn‚Äôt just a clipboard helper; it‚Äôs a speed boost for your brain. With one simple command it grabs that text to feed those hungry LLMs the tokens they need and you are back to the fun part... prompting.

No more juggling files or flipping back and forth between text editors. Whether it‚Äôs code snippets, config files, or that critical .env file, **clip4llm** does the heavy lifting of copying all of those files at once so you can focus on what really matters: getting that sweet AI-generated insight.

Does **clip4llm** actually interact with ChatGPT or any other LLM API directly, absolutely not! That is your job. All it does is copy those text files you are working straight to your clipboard so you can do the real work of pasting them into your LLM of choice. Spend all the time this saves you sending more prompts to that LLM getting back those hallucinatory insights you crave.

## üåü Features

- **Hidden Gems:** Hidden files aren‚Äôt included by default, but you can include them to grab those `.env` secrets like a pro.
- **Size Matters:** File too big? Not a problem. Set a size limit and skip the heavyweights. Default: 32KB, because nobody needs a novel-length paste job consuming your precious context window.
- **Mind the Megabyte:** Output over 1MB gathered? Boom! That is too big so nope, not happening.
- **Binary Exclusion:** ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt speak binary‚Äîleave those files out automatically.
- **Config Magic:** Drop a `.clip4llm` config in your home directory or your project folder and forget about the command-line‚Äîyour preferences are locked and loaded.
- **Verbose Mode:** Want to see what‚Äôs going on behind the curtain? Crank up the verbosity and feel like a hacker.

## üîß Installation

### Option 1: Install using Go

You‚Äôve got Go installed, right? If not, ask ChatGPT how to install it and let's get going...


1. Install it the easy way:

   ```bash
   go install github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs/clip4llm@latest
   ```

2. Make sure those Go bins are in your path:

   ```bash
   export PATH=${PATH}:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
   ```

3. Check your setup (just because):

   ```bash
   clip4llm --help
   ```

### Option 2: Build from Source

You‚Äôve got Go installed, but want to manually build everything? Good for you, let's get started...

1. Clone the magic:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs/clip4llm.git
   cd clip4llm
   ```

2. Build it like a boss:

   ```bash
   go build -o clip4llm
   ```

3. Make it global:

   ```bash
   mv clip4llm /usr/local/bin/
   ```

4. Check your setup (just because):

   ```bash
   clip4llm --help
   ```

### Option 3: Download the Binary

1. Cruise over to [clip4llm Releases](https://github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs/clip4llm/releases) and snag the latest version for your OS‚ÄîMac, Linux, Windows, whatever team you roll with.
2. Unzip the file (or untar it if it's a tar.gz, whatever, you know what to do).
3. Move that binary into your PATH or let it chill in your downloads folder forever. Your call.
4. Fire up **clip4llm** and you're golden.

## üíª Usage

Time to flex. Navigate into your project directory and run:

```bash
clip4llm
```

This instantly grabs all non-hidden, non-binary files (under 32KB) in your current directory and copies them straight to your clipboard, ready for pasting into ChatGPT like a legend.

### Command-Line Options That Matter

- `--delimiter` ‚Äì Customize how each file is wrapped. Default is triple `'s because Markdown rocks, but make it whatever you like:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --delimiter="<<<END>>>"
  ```

- `--max-size` ‚Äì Need fatter files, up that max-size (KB) to something bigger if you have context window to burn:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --max-size=8
  ```

- `--include` ‚Äì By default those .files and .folders are left out, if you want them you need to specify them here:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --include=".github,*.env"
  ```

- `--exclude` ‚Äì Some files wasting those tokens, exclude 'em with style:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --exclude="LICENSE,*.md"
  ```

- `--verbose` ‚Äì Feeling nosy? Get the full play-by-play of what‚Äôs happening:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --verbose
  ```

### üî• Pro Tip Combos

- **Include Hidden Directory**: Maybe you need to debug that GitHub Action, include those files easily:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --include=".github"
  ```

- **Exclude Markdown Files**: Your empty markdown files not helping the LLM out, you can leave those out:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --exclude="*.md"
  ```

- **Exclude `node_modules`**: Because your 20 line TypeScript project pulled in 500MB of libraries and no way that LLM needs all that:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --exclude="node_modules"
  ```

- **Customize Your Flow**: Your file's may have some of those triple `'s so if you want different separators, you can set them:

  ```bash
  clip4llm --delimiter="<<<FILE>>>" --max-size=64
  ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Like a Boss

Set it once, and forget it. Place a `.clip4llm` file in your home directory (`~/.clip4llm`) or project directory (`pwd/.clip4llm`), and **clip4llm** will respect your preferences.

Sample `.clip4llm` file:

```properties
delimiter=```
max-size=32
include=.github,*.env
exclude=LICENSE,*.md
```
